## 💡 My Development Experience

Building DoneFlow was more than just writing code — it was about creating something with real utility.

I started learning the backend side of web development earlier this June. After completing tutorials on Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose, I knew it was time to build something to solidify my understanding. I decided to make an application that, even though not a unique or revolutionary idea, could have real-world usefulness.

So, I began working on an app that allows users to add their tasks with a lot of optional information and then focus on them. It also helps monitor their performance, focus, and productivity through a dashboard. I tried to include features I couldn't find in other apps without requiring subscriptions.

### Things I learned:
- Designing database schemas
- Optimal routing and managing API calls
- Logging errors and error handling
- Writing cleaner and more maintainable frontend code
- Using Git and GitHub for structured version control
- Modular Coding Architecture

### Things I want to improve in future projects:
- Better planning of interrelated parts of the site beforehand
- More optimal API calls, schema design, and routing
- More seamless UI/UX
- Setting up proper unit tests and integration tests
